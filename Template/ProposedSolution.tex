\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sect:solution}

% Here we provide a detailed description about our {\em W} system. We start by describing how to ...in~\ref{module1} then we proceed to show how module....

  

\subsection{Module 1}
\label{subsec:module1}

\textbf{Main Idea}
% describe the main idea of this module
We present a FileSpliter, which contains a set of algorithms used to support management of file splits. And the first module. We  create a method named combineFileSplits, which combines a number of dile splits into one CombineFileSplit (mapreduce). If number of splits to be combined is one, it returns this splits without creating a CombineFileSplit. 


\textbf{Algorithm}
% If exists, Provide the pseudo code of your first algorithm behind this module
% Line-by-Line or block-by-block explanation for the pseudo code with reference to the line or the block in the algorithm. 





\textbf{Example}
% Step-by-Step graphical example that show the steps of this module. Then the text to elaborate those figures.
